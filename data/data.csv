"Mortals! Hear the sacred scream: Freedom, freedom, freedom!  Hear the noise of broken chains,  see noble Equality enthroned.  Rises to the heights of the Earth  a new and glorious nation,  its head crowned with laurels,  and at her feet lying a Lion. May the laurels be eternal,  the ones we managed to win.  Let us live crowned with glory...  or swear to die gloriously. Mars himself seems to encourage  Greatness nestles in their bodies:  at their march they make everything tremble.  The dead Inca are shaken,  and in their bones the ardour revives  which renews their children  of the Motherland the ancient splendour. 	Mountain ranges and walls are felt to resound with horrible din:  the whole country is disturbed by cries  of revenge, of war and rage.  In the fiery tyrants the envy  spit the pestipherous bile;  their bloody standard they rise  provoking the most cruel combat. 	Don't you see them over Mexico and Quito throwing themselves with tenacious viciousness?  And who they cry, bathed in blood,  Potosí, Cochabamba and La Paz?  Don't you see them over sad Caracas  spreading mourning and weeping and death?  Don't you see them devouring as wild animals  all people who surrender to them? 	To you it dares, Argentines, the pride of the vile invader;  your fields it steps on, retelling  so many glories as winner.  But the brave ones, that united swore  their merry freedom to sustain,  to those blood-thirsty tigers  bold breasts they will know to oppose. 	The valiant Argentine to arms runs burning with determination and bravery,  the war bugler, as thunder,  in the fields of the South resounds.  Buenos Ayres opposes, leading  the people of the illustrious Union,  and with robust arms they tear  the arrogant Iberian lion. 	San José, San Lorenzo, Suipacha, both Piedras, Salta and Tucumán,  La Colonia and the same walls  of the tyrant in the Banda Oriental.  They are eternal signboards they say:  here the Argentine arm found triumph,  here the fierce oppressor of the Motherland  his proud neck bent. 	Victory to the Argentine warrior covered with its brilliant wings,  and embarrassed at this view the tyrant  with infamy took to flight.  Its flags, its arms surrender  as trophies to freedom,  and above wings of glory the people rise  the worthy throne of their great majesty. 	From one pole to the other resounds the fame of the sonorous bugler,  and of America the name showing  they repeat ""Mortals, hear:  The United Provinces of the South  have now displayed their most honorable throne"".  And the free people of the world reply:  ""We salute the great people of Argentina!"" 	May the laurels be eternal, that we knew how to win.  Let us live crowned with glory...  or swear to die gloriously!"

On the shores of the Caribbean,  famished the people fight,  horrors preferring  to treacherous health.  O, aye! for Cartagena  the abnegation is much,  and the shambles of death  its courage despises . From Boyacá in the fields,  the genius of glory,  for every ear a hero  undefeated crowned.  Soldiers without breastplate  won victory;  their virile breath  as shield served. Bolivar crosses the Andes  that two oceans bathe,  swords as sparks  shine in Junín.  Untameable centaurs  descend to the plains,  and a prescience begins to be felt,  of the epic the end. The victorious trumpet  in Ayacucho thunders,  that in every triumph grows  its formidable sound.  In its expansive thrust  Liberty is worn for the first time,  from the American sky  a pavilion forming. The virgin her hairs  pulls out in agony  and from her beloved widowed  hangs them on a cypress.  Regretting her hope  covered by a cold headstone,  but glorious pride  hallows her fair skin. Thus the motherland is formed,  Thermopylaes are breaking forth;  constellation of cyclops  its night brightened.  The trembling flower  finding the wind mortal,  underneath the laurels  safety sought. But it's not complete glory  to defeat in battle,  that the arm that fights  is encouraged by truth.  Independence alone  The great clamour doesn't silence;  if the sun illuminates everyone,  justice is liberty. From men the rights  Nariño's preaching,  the soul of struggle  prophetically taught.  Ricaurte in San Mateo,  in atoms flying,  ""Duty before life,""  with flames he wrote."
"The flag is flying,  Announcing complete independence;  The nation rises up  Because of the faith we have  In this our Comoria. Let us always have devotion  To love our Great Islands.

May God always help us;  Let us always have the firm resolve  To love our fatherland,  Love our religion and the world. The flag is flying.  From the Sixth of July  The Nation rises up;  Our Islands are lined up.  Maori and Anzuan, Moheli and Comore,  Let us always have devotion  To love our Great Islands."

Hail, the people who strong and intrepid,  Into war launched itself unto death!  When in warfare challenge of death,  Her slavery chains she broke.    None people deserves to be free  If he is slave, indolent and servile;  If in his heart the flame is not burning,  Which was sparked by heroic manliness.   But Quisqueya, the indomitable and brave,  Her head will always lift up high,  For if she were enslaved a thousand times,  Many more times shall she know how to be free.   If it will be exposed to ruse and deceit  Unto contempt of a real imposer,  On to Las Carreras! Beler! ...it were places  Where the traces of glory are found.   Where on the top of the heroic bastion,  The word of the libarated became flesh,  Where the genius of Sánchez and Duarte  Taught to be free or to die.   And if an unattended leader the splendor  Of these glorious events could ignore,  One has seen in Capotillo in the war  The flag of fire wave.   And the fire that lets the proud lion  Of Castilla become stupefied,  Removes him from the glorious beaches  Where the crossed banner waves.   Compatriots, let us proudly  Show our face, from today prouder than ever;  Quisqueya may be destroyed  But a slave again, never!   It is a sanctuary of love that every character  Of the fatherland feels alive!  And it is his coat of arms, the right;  And it is his device: be free or die.   Freedom that still rises cool-bloodedly  The victory in her triumphal car.  And the clarion of war re-echoes  Proclaiming his immortal glory.   Freedom! That the echo's touch  While they're full of noble tension  Our fields of glory repeat  Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! "

Her innate bravery shall not waver:  In every man there is an immortal hero  Who knows how to maintain the level  Of the proverbial valour of old.

"  Our land, our land, our Fatherland!  Ring out, dear word, oh sound!  No rising hill, or mountain grand,  No sloping dale, no northern strand,  There is, more loved, to be found,  Than this — our fathers’ ground.   Our land is poor, and so shall be  To him who gold will crave.  The strangers proudly pass, but we  Shall ever love this land, we see,  In moor, and fell, and isle and wave,  A golden land, so brave.   We love our rippling brooks, so bright,  Our gushing streams, so strong,  The whisper of dark woods, at night,  Our starry skies, our summer light,  All, all that we, in sight and song,  Have felt and lived among.   Here fought our fathers, without fear,  With sword, and plough, and thought.  And here, in clouded times, and clear,  With fortune in their front or rear,  Their Finnish hearts have beat, and wrought  And borne what bear they ought.   Who tells, of all the fights, the tale,  In which this folk withstood,  When war did rage from dale to dale,  When frost set in, with hunger’s wail?  Who measured all their pouring blood,  And all their patience good?   And it was here their blood was shed,  For us, here, on this shore;  And it was here their joys were bred,  Here, that their sighs were heaved and fled,  That people’s who our burdens bore  Before us, long before.   Here it is sweet and good, we wot,  All, too, is giv’n us here;  However fate may cast our lot,  A land, a fatherland, we’ve got.  Will there a thing on earth appear  More worthy, to hold dear?   And here’s, and here’s this fatherland,  Here every eye it sees;  And we can stretch a pointing hand,  To show, with joy, its sea and strand,  And say, “Behold this country, this,  Our Fatherland it is.”   And if we once were made to rise  To gold clouds, from below,  And if we moved in starry skies,  Where no one weeps, where no one sighs,  To this poor lonely country, though,  Our longing hearts would go.   Oh land, the thousand lakes’ own land,  Of faith, and lay, and glee,  Where life’s main sea gave us a strand,  Our fore-time’s land, our future’s land,  Shy of thy poorness, never be,  Be calm, be glad, be free!   Thy blossom, hidden now from sight,  Shall burst its bud ere long.  Lo! from our love, shall rise aright,  Thy sun, thy hope, thy joy, thy light,  And higher, once, more full and strong,  Shall ring Our Country’s song. "

Indian maiden, virgin and beautiful you slept,  Of your seas to the resonant song,  When lying in your valleys of gold,  The bold navigator found you;  And on seeing your enrapturing beauty,  To the inflowing ideal of your enchantment,  The blue hem of your splendid mantle  With a kiss of love blessed. Your flag is a splendor of sky  Crossed with a band of snow;  And there can be seen, in its sacred depths,  Five pale blue stars.  In your emblem, which a rough sea  With its wild waves shields,  Behind the bare summit of a volcano,  There is a star of clean light. From a country where the sun rises,  Beyond the blue Atlantic,  That man who had dreamt you  In search of you he launched to sea.  When you raised your pale forehead,  In the lively anxiousness of your hope,  Under the gentle dome of your sky  Already floated a strange banner. Your flag is a splendor of sky  Crossed with a band of snow;  And there can be seen, in its sacred depths,  Five pale blue stars.  In your emblem, which a rough sea  With its wild waves shields,  Behind the bare summit of a volcano,  There is a star of clean light. It was useless that your beloved Indian  Rushed into the fight with ire,  Because, covered with his blood, Lempira,  In the deep night he sank;  And of the heroic deed, in memory,  The legend alone has kept  A sepulcher in a forgotten place,  And the severe profile of a mountain peak. Your flag is a splendor of sky  Crossed with a band of snow;  And there can be seen, in its sacred depths,  Five pale blue stars.  In your emblem, which a rough sea  With its wild waves shields,  Behind the bare summit of a volcano,  There is a star of clean light. For three centuries your children heard  The imperious mandate of the master;  For three centuries your useless complaint  In the blue atmosphere was lost  But one glorious day your ear  Perceived, powerful and distant,  That there, far away, over the Atlantic,  Indignantly, a lion roared Your flag is a splendor of sky  Crossed with a band of snow;  And there can be seen, in its sacred depths,  Five pale blue stars.  In your emblem, which a rough sea  With its wild waves shields,  Behind the bare summit of a volcano,  There is a star of clean light. It was France, the free, the heroic,  Which in its dreams of centuries slept,  Awoke irate to life  At the virile protest of Danton:  It was France, who sent to the death  The head of the consecrated King,  And which built up proudly at its side,  The altar of the goddess of Reason. Your flag is a splendor of sky  Crossed with a band of snow;  And there can be seen, in its sacred depths,  Five pale blue stars.  In your emblem, which a rough sea  With its wild waves shields,  Behind the bare summit of a volcano,  There is a star of clean light. You also, oh my country!, arose  From your servile deep sleep;  You also showed the world  The infamous shackle destroyed.  And in your blessed soil, behind the tall  Hair of the wild jungle,  Like a bird of black feathers,  The fleeting colony was lost. Your flag is a splendor of sky  Crossed with a band of snow;  And there can be seen, in its sacred depths,  Five pale blue stars.  In your emblem, which a rough sea  With its wild waves shields,  Behind the bare summit of a volcano,  There is a star of clean light. To guard this divine emblem  We shall march, oh fatherland, to the death;  Our luck will be generous  If we die thinking of your love.  Defending your holy flag,  And shrouded in its glorious folds,  There will be many, Honduras, your dead,  But all shall fall with honor."
"O Lord, bless the nation of Hungary  With your grace and bounty  Extend over it your guarding arm  During strife with its enemies  Long torn by ill fate  Bring upon it a time of relief  This nation has suffered for all sins  Of the past and of the future!  You brought our ancestors up  Over the Carpathians' holy peaks  By You was won a beautiful homeland  For Bendeguz's sons  And wherever flow the rivers of  The Tisza and the Danube  Árpád our hero's descendants  Will root and bloom.  	 For us on the plains of the Kuns  You ripened the wheat  In the grape fields of Tokaj  You dripped sweet nectar  Our flag you often planted  On the wild Turk's earthworks  And under Mátyás' grave army whimpered  Vienna's ""proud fort.""  	  Ah, but for our sins  Anger gathered in Your bosom  And You struck with Your lightning  From Your thundering clouds  Now the plundering Mongols' arrows  You swarmed over us  Then the Turks' slave yoke  We took upon our shoulders.  	  How often came from the mouths  Of Osman's barbarian nation  Over the corpses of our defeated army  A victory song!  How often did your own son agress  My homeland, upon your breast,  And you became because of your own sons  Your own sons' funeral urn!  	 The fugitive hid, and towards him  The sword reached into his cave  Looking everywhere he could not find  His home in his homeland  Climbs the mountain, descends the valley  Sadness and despair his companions  Sea of blood beneath his feet  Ocean of flame above.  	  Castle stood, now a heap of stones  Happiness and joy fluttered,  Groans of death, weeping  Now sound in their place.  And Ah! Freedom does not bloom  From the blood of the dead,  Torturous slavery's tears fall  From the burning eyes of the orphans!  	  	 Pity, O Lord, the Hungarians  Who are tossed by waves of danger  Extend over it your guarding arm  On the sea of its misery  Long torn by ill fate  Bring upon it a time of relief  They who have suffered for all sins  Of the past and of the future!

"As long as in the heart, within,  A Jewish soul still yearns,  And onward, towards the ends of the east,  An eye still looks toward Zion;  Our hope is not yet lost,  The ancient hope,  To return to the land of our fathers,  The city where David encamped.

Hear, O my brothers in the lands of exile,  The voice of one of our visionaries,  (Who declares) That only with the very last Jew —  Only there is the end of our hope!

"Be a helper for God, and censure what is forbidden, And turn with the law which, which He wants you to follow, Hold no one to be useful or harmful, except for Him, And walk the path of the chosen one, and die while you are on it! For what was sufficient for the first of us, is sufficient for the last one, too. And leave those people who do evil things with respect to God. They misrepresented him by making him similar, and made all kinds of excuses. They made bold claims, and blackened notebooks. They let the nomads and the sedentary people, both make bitter experiences, And the great sins of their [doctrinal] innovations bequeathed small. And just in case a disputant, calls you to dispute about their claims, Do not, then, dispute on them, except by way of an external dispute."

"William of Nassau am I of German[12] blood. Loyal to the fatherland I will remain until I die. A prince of Orange, I am, free and fearless. The king of Spain I have always honoured.  To live in fear of God I have always attempted. Because of this I was ousted bereft of my land and my people. But God will reign me like a good instrument. So that I may return in my reign.  Hold on my subjects, who are honest by nature. God will not abandon you even though you now are in despair. He who tries to live piously, must pray to God day and night, that He will give me the strength that I may relieve you.  My body or wealth altogether I did not spare to help you. My noble brothers have shown you this as well: Count Adolf died in Frisia during the battle His soul in eternal life awaits the final judgement.  Born nobly and highly, of imperial descent, Chosen a prince of the empire, Like a honest Christian, for the honoured word of God, I have without fear like a fearless hero, ventured my own noble blood.  My shield and reliance are you, o God my Lord. It is you on whom I want to rely, never leave me again. [Grant] that I may remain brave, your servant for always, and [may] defeat the tyranny, which pierces my heart  From all those that burden me and are my pursuers, my God, do save your loyal servant. That they may not surprise me with their wicked plans nor wash their hands in my innocent blood.  Like David, who was forced to flee from Saul, the tyrant. I had to sigh, as did many other nobles. But God raised him, relieving him of despair, and gave him a kingdom very great in Israel.  After this sourness I will receive from God my Lord the sweetness For that longs so much my noble mind which is that I may die with honour in the fields, and gain an eternal realm as a faithful hero.  Nothing makes me pity so much in my adversity, then that are seen to be impoverishing the good lands of the King That you are molested by the Spaniards, O Noble Netherlands sweet, when I think of that, my noble heart bleeds.  Seated [on horseback] like a prince, with my armed forces, Defied by the tyrant, I awaited the battle. Those dug in at Maastricht were afraid of my might People saw my horsemen ride bravely through the fields.  If it had been the Lord's will, at the time, I would have gladly relieved you of this heavy tempest. But the Lord above, who rules all, He who we should always praise, did not desire so.  By a Christian mood was driven My princely heart Steadfast remained my heart in adversity To the Lord I prayed, from the bottom of my heart, that He may save my cause, and proclaim my innocence.  Farewell, my poor sheep, who are in deep despair. Your shepherd will not sleep, even though you are now dispersed. Turn to God, accept his curing word. Live as a good Christian; soon, it will be finished here .  I want to confess to God, and to his great power that I have never despised the King. except that to God the Lord, the highest Majesty I've been obedient in justice."

Of thunder and of brimstone should they perish   Those who flee our glorious endeavor   When our land or our mother with tears in her heart,   Will ask us to cross through swords and blazing fire.    Didn't we have enough of the yatagan of the barbaric crescent   Whose fatal wounds even today we still feel?   Now the knout[6] is intruding our ancestral homes,   But we give witness before the Lord that alive, we do not accept it    Didn't we have enough of the blinded despotism   Whose yoke, like cattle, for centuries we've carried?   Now let the cruel ones try, in their blind arrogance,   To take away our language, we'll give it only if we're dead!    Romanians from the four corners, now or never   Unite in thought, unite in feeling   Proclaim to the wide world that the Danube is stolen   Through intrigue and coercion, sly machinations.    Priests, lead with your crucifixes! Because our army is Christian,   The motto is Liberty and its goal is holy,   Better to die in battle, in full glory,   Than to once again be slaves upon our ancient ground!   "
